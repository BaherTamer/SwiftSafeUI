# SwiftSafeUI
**SwiftSafeUI** is a Swift package designed to streamline the management of deprecated SwiftUI APIs across OS versions. It provides a clean and efficient way to handle deprecation logic, ensuring your app always uses the latest APIs while seamlessly falling back to older, deprecated ones when necessary.

<br/>

### Why Deprecation Handling Matters?
As SwiftUI evolves, Apple frequently introduces new APIs and deprecates older ones. Supporting multiple OS versions can lead to technical debt, as developers need to maintain compatibility without cluttering their code with version checks, conditional logic, and workarounds. Over time, this can make the codebase harder to maintain, slower to adapt to new changes, and more prone to bugs.

<br/>

### What SwiftSafeUI Solves?
**SwiftSafeUI** simplifies managing deprecated APIs in SwiftUI, providing a structured and efficient approach to handling version-specific UI changes across different OS versions. It helps you:

1. **Seamlessly handle deprecations:** Automatically uses the latest SwiftUI APIs while gracefully falling back to older alternatives when needed.
2. **Reduce boilerplate and complexity:** Eliminates the need for scattered version checks and conditional logic, centralizing compatibility handling.
3. **Future-proof your codebase:** Ensures your app remains adaptable as SwiftUI evolves, reducing manual maintenance and technical debt.
4. **Improve scalability and maintainability:** Keeps your UI code clean, structured, and responsive, regardless of the OS versions your app supports.
5. **Streamline SwiftUI development:** Provides safe modifiers, views, and environment values that abstract away compatibility concerns, allowing you to focus on building features.
