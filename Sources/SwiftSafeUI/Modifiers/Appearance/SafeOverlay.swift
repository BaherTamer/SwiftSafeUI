    /// This modifier applies the overlay views using the appropriate modifier based on the iOS version.

    /// If the device is running iOS 15.0 or later,
    /// it uses the [``overlay(alignment:content:)``](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/overlay(alignment:content:)) modifier.
    /// For earlier versions, it falls back to the [``overlay(_:alignment:)``](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/overlay(_:alignment:)) modifier.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - alignment: The alignment that the modifier uses to position the implicit `ZStack` that groups the overlay views. The default is `Alignment.center`.
    ///   - overlayContent: A `ViewBuilder` closure that provides the views to draw in front of this view, stacked in the order that you list them. The last view that you list appears at the front of the stack.
    ///   
    /// - Returns: A view that applies the specified overlay views.
