    /// This modifier applies the background views using the appropriate modifier based on the iOS version.

    /// If the device is running iOS 15.0 or later,
    /// it uses the [``background(alignment:content:)``](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/background(alignment:content:)) modifier.
    /// For earlier versions, it falls back to the [``background(_:alignment:)``](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/background(_:alignment:))  modifier.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - alignment: The alignment that the modifier uses to position the implicit `ZStack` that groups the background views. The default is `Alignment.center`.
    ///   - backgroundContent: A `ViewBuilder` closure that provides the views to draw behind this view, stacked in a cascading order from bottom to top. The last view that you list appears at the front of the stack.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A view that applies the specified background views.
