## Overview
**SafeViews** are custom `SwiftUI` views included in the **SwiftSafeUI** package, designed to help developers manage deprecation issues and maintain compatibility across various iOS versions. These views encapsulate the necessary logic to ensure your app utilizes the latest views initializers and gracefully falls back to deprecated ones when needed. By using **SafeViews**, you can create a seamless and consistent user interface without worrying about version-specific APIs.
